### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub!

My name is Krishaanth, I'm a student and undergraduate teaching assistant at York University in the Specialized Honours BSc. Computer Science program.

Here in my GitHub you can see the projects I've worked on and collaborated on with others. I enjoy learning new technologies! I've built Big Data streaming applications, Web Apps, Android Apps, Bots, Scrapers and more! Using tools such as React JSX, Java Spring Boot, Python, SQL, Spark, Hadoop and more!
